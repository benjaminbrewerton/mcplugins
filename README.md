# Minecraft Plugins
These are a few of my old minecraft plugins I developed in year 12 while 
learning to code for the first time in Java with the CraftBukkit framework

## What they are
- zEV is a plugin for hosting events where players participate and earn credits from completing challenges
- zKE is a management plugin for all basic functionalities of the server and its staff members including custom tab organisation
- zWZ is a battle arena/sandbox style of gamemode where players compete for objectives and kills on other players
